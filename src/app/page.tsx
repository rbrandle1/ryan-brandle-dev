/* Todo: 
* Make Article pages and article specific components. ImageGrid component.... variations.
* Add backup words for each FeaturedProject
* figure out section spacing. avoid calc's and use variables instead.
* Create a boilerplate ts file for each page to include commonly used things like project title, meta tags, etc.
* update crop icon to replace LinkedIn icon
* make scroll arrow a circular button... or a square, with accent background.
* Make buttons view link
* double check vertical spacing on home page through various viewport sizes.
* Try updating to line-height units: https://12daysofweb.dev/2024/css-margin-trim-line-height-units/
* Accessibility audit. check svg icons and accessibility. do they need a role? alts, etc.
* download and host images locally instead of direct url from unsplash.
* make favicon
* Read through all text, footer text, etc and finalize.
* Get peer review
* set up a new contact email

* BUGS:
* have logo present on page load, and does not animate in.
* In safari, the filter blur is buggy. Sometimes it fills space, sometimes it doesn't. Potentially update the blur for a background image instead of a css filter. Also might be affecting performance with such a large blur.
* in safari, underlines in link doesn't change on theme change. It does change when you hover over the link.

* THEME PICKER LOCAL STORAGE ISSUES:
* Continue setting up theme provider and theme picker. TRY creating a nested layout to manage the theme state. So the body, header, footer etc are not reloaded on every page load, therefore not causing a FOUC.
* Solve server 500 error on page load. Try using the window object to check if it's loaded in the ThemePicker useEffect and maybe use an empty string as the default theme? This would likely create a FOUC though. Try refactoring with a ThemeProvider component to manage the theme state.
* Maybe put my header in a top level component so it doesn't reload disappear and come back on every pg load? nested layout?

* FUTURE CLEANUP AND EXPLORATION:
* Make a mixin or a variable for hover translate animations.
* update margins for margin-inline and margin-block elements.
* Incorporate purple as a gradient to pink?
* Try setting base space from 1.6 to 1.8. Also, might need to adjust the real big spaces % max to be larger for a more noticeable difference. Can also run the calculation to a raw value to enhance performance.
	
* TALKING POINTS, TROUBLESHOOTING, ETC, WITH THIS PROJECT:
	* State management. I had to decide whether prop drilling or using react context was the best approach. I went with context because I came to understand how multiple components could be affected by the theme state, and the best way to manage it was to avoid prop drilling.
	* 
	* Animation keyframe rendering issues with Turbopack. I had to move the keyframes to the top of the file to get them to render, instead of utilizing them as css module partials like the other utilities. Also, general challenges getting animations to work smoothly in a responsive way to themes changing.
	* 
	* Turbopack issues with utilizing sass :export. I tried to utilize the sass :export to create breakpoint variables to use as JS min/max widths but ultimately couldn't get it to work.
	* 
	* Issues with local state to immediately update the theme state. Currently there is a 500 error on page load due to the initial localstorage value not being set. Would love to come back to this.
	* 
	* Design system. Utilizing design tokens to manage colors, spacing, and typography. Spacing and typography utilize fluid unit techniques.
	* Multiple theme systems and variables. Light and dark themes exist in addition to the theme picker accent colors.
	* 
	* Accessibility. Ensuring that the site is accessible and compliant with WCAG 2.1. And is navigable and usable for all.
	* 
	* Responsive vertical text was a challenge and there are likely better ways to do this. But I took a very granular and specific approach for this instance to this to make sure it works. Don't consider this a modular solution.
	* 
	* Utilizing inline css variables and ternary operators to manage various styles on component. Instead of using a class name to manage styles.
